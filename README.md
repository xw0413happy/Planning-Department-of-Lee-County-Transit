# Web Page Design for Planning Department of Lee County Transit

The publich website I created is basically combining *two files - one is HTML, another is CSS*. Later I will work on JavaScript, PHP, and also embed jQuery library.
The **purpose** of developing this web page is to provide a general combination of entire work output of Planning Department, to make the staff easier to reach the data.



## File Format

This project is used by the following file formats:

- **Electrification Transition Worksheet**, which is provided by *Deputy Director*
- **logo and images**, which are provided/downloaded from *google and Proterra official website*


## Deployment--Ignore (for my other python projects)

To deploy this project run, the following modules are needed to be imported as belows.

```bash
import pandas as pd
import os
import math
import datetime
from datetime import datetime
from contextlib import redirect_stdout
import tkinter as tk
import tkinter.font as font
from tkinter import filedialog
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
```

To convert .py into .exe, copy the following command onto your Anaconda Prompt
```bash
auto-py-to-exe
```



## Repository Structure

#### Notes:


- (1) form.html is just a test file, not working for web page display
- (2) index2.html and style2.css are example files, not working for web page display 
- (3) Other web pages are in design progress


| File Name | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `index` | `.html` | **Required**. It is the home page. |

#### Other supplementary files description

```http
If you see any other separate .css files, they should be combined into "style.css" file later
```

| File Name | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
